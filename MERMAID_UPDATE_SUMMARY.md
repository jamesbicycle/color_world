### 2. Modular Code Structure
Reorganized coloring pages into separate files for better maintainability:

**New Structure**:
```
lib/models/
├── coloring_page.dart              # ColoringPage model class only
├── all_coloring_pages.dart         # Imports all pages, exports ColoringPages class
└── coloring_pages/                 # Individual page definitions
    ├── flower_page.dart            # Beautiful Flower
    ├── butterfly_page.dart         # Happy Butterfly  
    ├── house_page.dart             # Cozy House
    ├── rainbow_page.dart           # Magic Rainbow
    ├── ocean_page.dart             # Ocean Adventure
    ├── garden_page.dart            # Magical Garden
    └── mermaid_page.dart           # Enchanted Mermaid (NEW)
